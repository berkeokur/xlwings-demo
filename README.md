Please read the docs: https://docs.xlwings.org/en/stable/remote_interpreter.html

This sample works with:

* Excel on the web
* Google Sheets

There are the following samples:

* `app`: A simple hello world sample and a sample using yfinance to fetch stock history data as a pandas DataFrame
* `app_google_auth`: This sample shows how you can identify users on the backend by sending over `ScriptApp.getOAuthToken()` as the `apiToken`
